# 100-Days-of-Code-Python
---
I decided to challenge myself and commit to learning python properly by attempting the 100 days of code challenge.

Now I can be a bit impaitent so there may be one or two days commited in a day! However, in the spirit of 100 days of code, I will do one a day and with each day, a project to tie all the concepts together!

## HAPPY CODING!!
