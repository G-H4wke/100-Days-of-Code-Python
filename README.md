# 100-Days-of-Code-Python
---
I decided to challenge myself and commit to learning python properly by attempting the 100 days of code challenge.

Now I can be a bit impatient so there may be one or two days committed in a day! However, in the spirit of 100 days of code, I will do one a day and with each day, a project to tie all the concepts together!

## HAPPY CODING!!

## Day 1 - Band Name Generator
So for this day we looked at the print function. One of the most common functions you will
find used in the early days of your python journey.

Within this day we also looked at the input function. This function allows you to
take a string of text inputted by the user, return the resulting value and essential
"replace" the input function.

### What do you mean replace?
Well the input function will work alot like print where you can provide a string of
text to display to the user, such as "Hello, what is your name?". As soon as that statement
has been printed, you will see the cursor waiting for input. Once the user has entered
the string they want such as "Gabriel", that value is replacing the original printed text

pretty neat right?

### What can I do with it?

Well since it returns a value, rather than it just replace what was in the input,
 we can store that in a variable such as:
```python
name = input("Hello, What is your name? ")
```

Now we have a value, and we have stored it in a variable, we can use it wherever we like!

This was the basis of the Band Name Generator by storing inputs and coming up with a cool
band name.
